Machine Learning Practice. Implimenting the project following the Chapter-5 on O'REILLY's Hands-On Machine Learning. <br>

**Goal**: Predict breast cancer given all other values with the use of SVMs. <br>
**Approach**:
<ol>
    <li>Supervised Learning task, because given labeled traning examples.</li>
    <li>Classification task.</li>
    <li>There is no continuous flow of data, no need to adjust to changing data, and the data is small enough to fit in memmory: Batch Learning</li>
</ol>

**Data:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/version/2#)<br>

SVM's goal is to have largest possible margin between decision boundary that separetes the classes and the training instances.
